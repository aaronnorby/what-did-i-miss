# What did I miss? 

I don't know about you, but sometimes I get out of the loop for a few days, maybe
even a week. I'd like a convenient way to know what happened during that time. This
web app lets you select your favorite NPR show and then displays summaries of all
the stories from that show in the last seven days, along with time stamps and links
to the story page and mp4 audio of the story. 

For those curious, the app is written using Backbone with Handlebars and a Node
Express server with a MySQL database in the back for storing show information (and
maybe in the future, for saving stories to look at later).
